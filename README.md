## How to Run the Code


### Dependencies
This module was built in raw **python 3+**. the only external modules used were:

* `collections`: for their implementation of a queue
* `numpy`: for the matrix representation of the occupancy set
* `random`: for randomly generating traffic patterns through the occupancy set

To get these dependencies, simply type:
* `pip3 install collections`
* `pip3 install numpy` 
* `pip3 install random` 

into a terminal that has the `*/PYTHON_3XX_INSTALL_DIR/Scripts/` and `*/PYTHON_3XX_INSTALL_DIR/` directories on its path, and you should be able to get these dependencies if you do not have them already.
